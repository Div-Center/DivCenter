[Back to Top](#chatmuch)

### Cooperation Plan

- **What are the key strengths of each person on the team?**

  Dion - Back squat: 285 x 20. Suave with analytics. Project management, big picture person.

  Tyler - Great father, first of all. Excellent choice of shirts. Scalable. Humble. Jack of all trades.

  Alex -

  Tim - Great hamstrings. Good taste in effervescent mineral water. Communication skills are second-to-none. Holistic approach.

- **How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**

  We really fit together like puzzle pieces -- all having pretty good JS skills and understanding, and individual skills that complement each other.

- **In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?**

  Dion - public speaking

  Alex -

  Tyler - communication

  Tim - business acumen

- **Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?**

  We plan on meeting up every day at 9am and having an all-hands-on-deck style meeting. We will update each other every step along the way, but those meetings will serve as the foundation of our communication. We will also use GitHub Projects for project management to ensure that the workload is evenly distributed. We will also be available on Slack for any potential assistance requests.

### Conflict Plan

- **What will be your group's process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**

  Our conflict resolution process will be to discuss any issues that come up as an entire team, and hold stand-up meetings as a team if issues persist. We will ask Jacob Knaack to intervene should the issue spiral out of control.

- **What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**

  This will be addressed as part of our conflict resolution plan above.

- **How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

  Trust the process, and be kind to one another (see: Mr. Rogers). Keep cool and care.

- **How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

  Ask if that team member needs help. Have them be a part of pair programming. Ultimately, we will divvy up tasks every morning and come to an agreement on what everyone will be working on for that day.

- **How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

  We will escalate any major issues to Jacob Knaack.

### Communication Plan

- **What hours will you be available to communicate?**

  9-5 for quick responses, with some leeway for the evening.

- **What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone â€¦)?**

  Slack and Remo.

- **How often will you take breaks?**

  Every hour or so, but no formal breaks.

- **What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

  Scale back our stretch goals, focus on the MVP alone.

- **How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**

  Slack, turn on push notifications.

- **What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voice is heard?**

  Tim Egorov will be communication manager and ensure everyone has a say.

- **How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**

  Communication manager will ensure that everyone gets a chance to speak during standups.

### Work Plan

- **How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**

  GitHub Pages will serve as our project management tool. 

- **What project management tool will be used?**

  GitHub Pages.

### Git Process

- **What components of your project will live on GitHub?**

  All of them.

- **How will you share the repository with your teammates?**

  We created an organization where all of us are members.

- **What is your Git flow?**

  ACP but every new feature will live on a different branch. Dev branch and production branch. We will have code reviews before approving merges, we'll need at least 2 approvals so no one can merge single-handedly.

- **Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:**

  - How many people must review a PR?
    Two.
  - Who merges PRs?
    Non-authors.
  - How often will you merge?
    ACP by end of day, or whenever a major feature is implemented (after code review).
  - How will you communicate that it's time to merge?
    We will slack each other when a major feature is ready to be merged, and we will have a review at the end of each day. We will also be on Remo throughout the day and maintaining regular communication.
